Introduction to  OpenVINO™**

Open Visual Inference and Neural network Optimization(OpenVINO) is an open-source toolkit developed by Intel. It is a set of libraries, optimization tools, and information resources that can be used to fast-track the development of cost-effective computer vision and deep learning applications which emulate human vision.

Intel has developed an open API (OpenVINO) that allows us to execute a model across the devices without understanding the hardware details or the underlying libraries required to access them. Software developers and Data Scientists who work on computer vision can use this product to help speed up their solutions on a variety of platforms, including CPU, GPU, VPU, and FPGA. In short, One can optimize and deploy their trained neural networks and Deep Learning models quickly at the Edge.

**What’s inside the OpenVINO™ toolkit?**

**Model Optimizer:** It is a command-line tool that uses static model analysis for optimal execution of the deep learning model by adjusting the network. It produces an Intermediate Representation (IR) of the model which can be used as the input for the Inference engine.

We’ll look at three optimization techniques that OpenVINO provides to make the model faster. They include Quantization, Freezing, and Fusion.

**Quantization**

In OpenVINO, the weights and biases of the pre-trained models are available in a variety of precisions such as FP32, FP16, and INT8.

The higher precision model may produce better accuracy, but it is more complex and takes up more space, demanding a lot more computing power. Lowering model precision reduces model accuracy because we lose some critical information when we reduce model precision, resulting in a reduction in accuracy.

**Freezing**

Specific layers in training are frozen so that you can fine-tune and train on only a sample of them. It’s used as part of a larger model, notably Tensorflow models. When TensorFlow models are frozen, certain actions and metadata that are only needed for training are removed. Backpropagation, for example, is only necessary during training and not inference.

**Fusion**

In a nutshell, fusion means combing multiple-layer operations into a single operation. For TensorFlow topologies, grouped convolution fusing is a specialized optimization technique. The primary idea behind this optimization is to aggregate the convolutional results for the Split outputs and then recombine them in the same order as they came out of Split using a concatenation operation.

**Intermediate Representation (IR):** It has two files to describe the model (the ‘.XML’ contains key metadata and the ‘.bin’ file consists of the model’s weights and biases in binary format).

**Inference Engine:** The Inference Engine (IE) is a collection of C++ packages that provide a common API that allows users to do inference on either CPU or any other device. It provides an API for reading the MO’s IR files (.bin and.xml), setting inputs and outputs, and running the model on devices. It reads the Intermediate Representation and runs the model on the device of your choice. Python bindings are also offered in addition to the primary C++ implementation.

**Model Zoo:** It consists of a wide range of free, pre-trained deep learning models developed by Intel. Have a look at both Intel and the public models and choose the right model for your solution. The purpose of Model Zoo is to execute, train, and deploy Intel-optimized models efficiently. These models can be used for Image Recognition, Language Modeling, Image Segmentation, Object Detection, etc.

**What is the workflow for deploying the model using OpenVINO™?**

Due to the multiple frameworks used for numerous reasons, the deployment procedure may be difficult. Another issue that complicates the process is that inference might be done on platforms that are limited in terms of hardware and software; thus, the training framework should not be used. Alternatively, specific hardware-optimized inference APIs could be used.

OpenVINO toolkit includes two primary components: Model Optimizer and Inference Engine, which allow developers to maximize the performance of their pre-trained models.

**What are the benefits of using OpenVINO?**

In layman’s terms, you should use OpenVINO when you’d like to run many models on different devices at the same time
